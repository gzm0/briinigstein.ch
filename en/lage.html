      The Haslital (Hasli-Valley) lies in the geographic center of
      Switzerland between Luzern and Interlaken &ndash; surrounded by
      the famous Alpine passes Grimsel, Susten and Brünig in the
      Bernese Oberland. Railway lines and highways connect the region
      with Zürich, Luzern, Interlaken and Bern as well as major cities
      in Switzerland and abroad. The Haslital is a vantage point for
      the Alps.
